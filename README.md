## Project:
A Smart contract on the Cardano blockchain that can help to eliminate Child Labour.

## Suggested Solution:
A smart contract solution to be implemented. Specifically, smart contracts will be created for two features of the solution:
- Mining of compliance NFTs once the third party auditor has issued favorable monthly qualification. 
This contract is written in the AntiChildLaborToken.hs file
- Vesting contract to allow the supplier to claim his reward once he has in his possession the token certifying the fulfillment of the month's objectives. 
This contract is written in the AntiChildLaborReward.hs file
